# Customer Churn Prediction – End-to-End ML Pipeline

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow for predicting customer churn using structured business data. The goal is to build a reliable and interpretable model that can be used by business teams to proactively identify at-risk customers.

## Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical business problem where retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. In this project, I built a complete ML pipeline starting from data ingestion and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and inference-ready structure.

## Key Steps
- Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to understand customer behavior patterns
- Applied feature engineering techniques to improve model performance
- Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models to establish a strong baseline
- Selected appropriate evaluation metrics to balance precision and recall
- Organized the project with a production-ready structure for future deployment

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Results
The final model achieved stable performance with improved recall on churned customers, making it suitable for business-driven retention strategies.

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning and advanced ensemble models
- Model deployment using REST APIs
- Monitoring model performance and data drift

## How to Run (Local)
1. Install dependencies: pandas, scikit-learn,joblib
2. Run baseline training:
   python src/train_baseline.py
